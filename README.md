# Vanilla JavaScript Weather App

## Description

This project is a simple weather application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

The application allows users to enter a city name through a text input field and fetches real-time weather data for that city using the OpenWeather API.

The main objective of this project is to understand API integration, asynchronous JavaScript using async/await, and exception handling using try-catch blocks.
